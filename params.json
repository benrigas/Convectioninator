I've downloaded stuff from github before, but never set up a repository myself, so here we go...\r\n\r\nRight now everything is open to the world, I don't see much reason to lock things down now. I've added the test sketch I used to get the Arduino talking to the LCDs. Also I started a README and figured we could list all of the Arduino libraries you need to have installed for our many components. Add as you see fit!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
